Our Application is essentially an organized location for items with an expiry date that provides a simple,
easy way to add products to it and view whether they have expired, will expire, or are not expiring soon.
It also provides users with the option to upload the product information in multiple ways including
through manual data entry, scanning barcodes or capturing/uploading photos. Furthermore, to provide
users with a quick way to view expiry dates in one place, users are also allowed the option to view a
calendar with their uploaded product expiry dates listed and to sync that calendar with a pre-existing
one as well.

## Getting Started

Here I have developed a barcode functionality to scan the barcodes of the products and fetch the product ID.

To run the flutter app please install the flutter and dart plugins on your VS code.
Once setting up is done pull the code from this GITHUB repository or download a Zip file and open the folder in VS code.

### IDE run args/configuration
To set this up in your IDE of choice, you can use:

Android Studio: "Edit Configurations" (in your run configurations) â†’ "Additional run args".
VS Code: search for "Flutter run additional args" in your user settings.
In both cases, add --no-sound-null-safety.

Once the above steps are followed please run the below command in your terminal:
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety

Now you are all set to launch the application.
Please connect your android mobile using debug mode and allow the USB debugging permission.

Go ahead and run the application it may take few moments to build the gradle file and install the apk on your device once your application is launched you are good to use it.

Thank you for visiting my repo.
