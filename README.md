Our Application is essentially an organized location for items with an expiry date that provides a simple,
easy way to add products to it and view whether they have expired, will expire, or are not expiring soon.
It also provides users with the option to upload the product information in multiple ways including
through manual data entry, scanning barcodes or capturing/uploading photos. Furthermore, to provide
users with a quick way to view expiry dates in one place, users are also allowed the option to view a
calendar with their uploaded product expiry dates listed and to sync that calendar with a pre-existing
one as well.
